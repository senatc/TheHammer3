Total Source Control!
What’s New in The Hammer v. 2.0 


Since last release of TheHammer v. 1.5.3, we implemented a lot 
of new features, bug fixes and tools into this fine Visual Dataflex 
Source Editor, created by the team of Dataflex Professionals and 
just friends.

General
=======

- The key feature of this release – increased stability in times. 
  New revision of well known Editor for Visual Dataflex became much 
  better than we expected before.
- Support of VDF8 workspaces added. TheHammer now able to see and work 
  with sources from VDF 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 workspaces.
- Implemented character translation for keyboard input if necessary.
- Fixed a bug in close all routine (only 5 views were closed at a time)
- Fixed the behavior of switch_next_view and switch_prior_view so that 
  the CodeMax commands window next and window previous and alt+f6 and 
  ctr+f6 reacts the same. Also fixed the order for the window to display.
- Fixed the display "slot-machine" on switching between views and 
  closing views
- If number of recent files more than 9 (nine), TheHammer was unable 
  to open recent files below 9 listed first. Fixed.
- If program source file including full path more than 80 characters, 
  TheHammer can’t work out it correctly. Fixed.
- If you did not set working directory and have use external DLLs placed 
  under Program path, TheHammer was unable correctly starts the compiled 
  application. Fixed.
- Resizing issue with Error List (renamed to Message Area) has been fixed.
- The splitter bar sometimes was lost by TheHammer. Fixed.
- The rawfile error generated on startup fixed.
- Flickering during switching between the views reduced dramatically.


Code Lists
==========

- If request to show indexes given and user’s file has same number as one 
  of the numbers used by TheHammer database, editor shows indexes list for 
  own file. Fixed.
- If same data file name used in a workspace as TheHammer use, fields from 
  own file with same name shown. Fixed.
- If data file used in expressions, on typing if file name not separated 
  from others by space, TheHammer does not show fields list. Fixed.
- All code lists, used by TheHammer redesigned to be global (against local 
  to editor view) and to work via controls supplied by CodeSense (new TH 
  editor control) controls for.
- After opening field list, FD file (used for) remains opened. Fixed.
- Data file Index list now implemented for commands FIND, FOR_ALL and 
  procedure call SEND FIND TO DATAFILE_DD EQ ...


Source Code Parser
==================

- Fixed some a few general bug's in the parsing routine
- Complete new message transfer routine between parser.dll and TheHammer
- Parser.dll should be memory stable, fixed some bad memory leaks
- Added as many security checks (null pointers or invalid memory 
  blocks...) as possible
- Parsing speed improved
- All exceptions (fatal errors) in the parser thread are catched. If 
  such an exception occurs (which should only be very rarely) you will 
  get a message box and TheHammer don't abort abnormally.
- Splitted parser to one parser control object for the whole TheHammer 
  (the object controls creating/destroying, starting/stopping the parser 
  thread and receives all messages from the parser thread) and an original 
  parser object for each edit-window (which holds the parsed data). So all 
  possible crashes because of changing the edit-window and the resulting 
  troubles are gone.
- New datatypes introduced in VDF now parsed by TheHammer parser: datetime, 
  timespan, Address, BigInt, Char, Currency, DECIMAL, FLOAT, SHORT, UBIGINT, 
  UCHAR, UINTEGER, UShort


Editor Window
=============

- fixed bug on paste/cut operations
- CodeList / CodeTip new CodeMax engine implemented
- On pressing <CTRL>+<F1> editor calls case sensitive help of VDF, 
  supplying wrong keyword sequence instead of keyword selected. Fixed.
- fixed a bug on destroying CodeMax where the used font was tried to be 
  deleted before it was released by CodeMax


Main Menu, Toolbar and Status Bar
=================================

- Changed the file open dialog to a dialog that is able to open multiple 
  files at once
- Added new items to open Source, Packages, DDs and VDF System package 
  folders with a once click of the mouse.
- Main Menu enhanced, systemized and expanded with new items.
- Added new configurable Menu Items like 'Source' and 'Database' that 
  allows you access to the your famous tools to work with sources or 
  database (like Version Control Systems, Code Maintenance Utilities, 
  Database editors and viewers etc), All menus (Tools, Source and Database) 
  are fully configurable.
- Minor bugs fixed.
- Created one global floating popup menu for all edit-windows (since 
  the menu is always the same, it is wasting resources and only making 
  troubles to have a menu-object with about 30 arrays for each edit window.
- On click on Line/Column pane of Status Bar, TheHammer activates Goto Line 
  editor dialog. If “INS/OVR” pane clicked, editor toggles overtype mode, on 
  workspace name – pops up workspace selection dialog.
- Status Bar object completely redesigned and built on more sophisticated 
  class.
- Toolbar shadow worked incorrectly. Fixed.
- Toolbar Compile button worked incorrectly. Fixed.

  It allows you publish your source “as is” using HTML. Built-In utility 
  follow by TheHammer Editor options and highlights the published source 
  in same way as you see in editor window. This utility also configurable 
  via TheHammer System Options dialog and could be replaced by 3rd party
