      <H1 align=center>The Hammer FAQ/Manual V1.2</H1>
      <HR width="75%" SIZE=1>

      <P>This combined FAQ and manual is a  quick attempt at documentation 
      of the Hammer while a more formal manual and/or helpfile is created. At 
      present, I am just trying to get as much information down as possible, so 
      the formatting, grouping of topics, etc is pretty poor. Later this will be 
      split into a proper FAQ and Manual. As both the Hammer and my knowledge of 
      it are changing rapidly, not all of this information may still be (was 
      ever?) correct.</P>

      <H2><A name=setup>1. Getting Started</A></H2>
      <H3>1.1 <A name=hammer-loc>Where can I get the Hammer?</A></H3>
      <P>The Hammer is an open source project,  hosted at the VDF 
      Guidance website <A 
      href="http://www.vdf-guidance.com/">http://www.vdf-guidance.com/</A> </P>
      <H3>1.2 <A name=exe-install>How should I install the executable 
      version?</A></H3>
      <P>Download the setup file from VDF Guidance (see above). Before running 
      this, keep the following in mind.</P>
      <P>There are currently some bugs in the Hammer pathing routines that cause 
      problems if the Hammer is installed in a directory path that includes 
      spaces or long files names (Such as "Program Files"). Until these are 
      fixed you should install to a directory that uses standard DOS 8 character 
      pathing. (e.g. <a href="file:///C:/KPHAMMER">C:\KPHAMMER</a>)
      <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">**WVA: ARE THESE PROBLEMS STILL IN 
      THE HAMMER?</span></P>
      <P>Also, the installation process will create 2 VDF7 workspaces, one is called 
      CodeMax and is used by the Hammer itself. The other one is called VDFLNG 
      and is used by the ASDBC, the program that will fill the autosuggestion 
      database of the Hammer with your (sub)class information.  </P>
      <P>The location of the workspace is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Data Access 
      Corporation\Visual DataFlex\7\Workspaces\CodeMax. There is a similar workspace 
      created called VDFLNG with the same keys.</P>
      <H3>1.3 <A name=exe-remove>How do I un-install the Hammer?</A></H3>
      <P>Just click on uninstall from the menu or from &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; in 
      the configuration panel.<H2><A name=parts>2. Hammer Components</A></H2>
      <H3>2.1 <A name=parts-edit>Edit Window</A></H3>
      <P>The edit window is the CodeMax editing component, also used by Data 
      Access in the VDF IDE. All the actual editing is done here. The shortcut 
      keys, syntax coloration and some other features are configurable.</P>
      <H3>2.2 <A name=parts-codeview>Code View</A></H3>
      <P>The Code View window shows a tree which contains all the components 
      (objects, procedures, functions, etc) of the file being edited. As you 
      move around the edit window, you can synchronize the position in the code 
      view with the "Synchronize CodeView" (Crtl+S) command. The "Code Explorer" 
      (Alt+F1) will jump the focus to the CodeView or FileView, whichever is 
      shown. Continued usage of (Alt+F1) will then switch between the CodeView 
      and FileView tabs. To synchronize the edit with your location in the code 
      view, hit Enter. Tab will return you to the edit window.</P>
      <H3>2.3 <A name=parts-fileview>File View</A></H3>
      <P>Sharing the same window as the CodeView, but on a different tab, the 
      File View displays a list of all the files that are referenced in the 
      edited file. Pressing Enter on one of these will open the selected file 
      for editing. </P>
      <H3>2.4 <A name=parts-dosbox>Smart Dos Box</A></H3>
      <P>The Smart Dos Box command starts an MSDos prompt that has as it's 
      current directory the AppSrc Directory of your currently selected 
      workspace. </P>
      <H3>2.5 <A name=parts-vdfcls>Class Reference</A></H3>
      <P>The Class Reference is a seperate program that is used to maintain and 
      view the Class Reference Database. This section has some bugs in it still. 
      If you get an error about workspace VDFLNG see <A 
      href="#exe-install">installation</A> 
      above. You may also get occasional errors about DFEDIT10.DLL, once on 
      startup and many times on entry to the Menu Writer. These are known bugs 
      and will be fixed in future versions of the Hammer.</P>
      <P>The Class Reference database holds a list of all known classes, and the 
      properties, methods, and events in each one. This information is used by 
      the Hammer for it's autosuggestion capabilities. The Class Explorer also 
      shows these for all parent classes and mixins, and is a handy 
      reference.</P>
      <H3>2.6 <A name=parts-asdb>ASDB Compiler</A></H3>
      <P>This compiler runs through the base classes, updating and expanding out 
      the autosuggest database. This should be done when ever the classes 
      change. It is done for you during installation.</P>
      <H2><A name=auto>3. Auto-Suggestion Capabilities.</A></H2>
      <H3>3.1 <A name=auto-object>Objects Auto-suggestion</A></H3>
      <P>A list with all available objects appears whenever you type a piece of 
      code where you need to enter an object reference. This will be activated 
      by the following statements:</P>
      <P>set <I>YourProperty</I> of ...<BR>get <I>YourFunction</I> of 
      ...<BR>send <I>YourMessage</I> to ...<BR></P>
      <H3>3.2 <A name=auto-proc>Procedure/Function Auto-suggestion</A></H3>
      <P>A list of all available methods appears whenever you are creating a 
      procedure in an object and helps you to override methods in objects. This 
      will be activated by the following statements:</P>
      <P>Procedure ...<BR>Function ... </P>
      <P>Note that this is based on your location in the file and also the 
      contents of the class database. If the list does not show, you may be 
      outside of any object, or the database may not know about the current 
      object.</P>
      <H3>3.3 <A name=auto-cc>Call Creator</A></H3>
      <P>This list is invoked whenever you type one of the following keywords 
      and press [Enter] afterwards.</P>
      <P>set [Enter]<BR>get [Enter]<BR>send [Enter]<BR>move [Enter]</P>
      <H3>3.4 <A name=auto-keys>Using Autosuggestion Lists</A></H3>
      <P>After the list pops up, you can just keep typing, and the list will 
      locate to the first matching line item, or use the mouse or arrow and 
      PageUp/Down keys to browse the list. Once the required item is found, 
      pressing tab will insert the item and leave the mouse on the same line, 
      while Enter will leave you on the next line. Escape will remove the 
      list.</P>
      <H3>3.5 <A name=auto-other>Other Suggestion Lists</A></H3>
      <P>Under the Tools menu there is a submenu titled AutoSuggestion Lists. 
      All the lists mentioned above are available here, as well as a Local 
      Variables List and a Key List. The same restrictions are placed on their 
      use here as when they appear automatically (eg - don't expect a procedure 
      list outside an object). 
      <H2><A name=menu>4. Menus and Toolbar</A></H2>
      <H3>4.1 <A name=menu-file>File Menu</A></H3>
      <P>This has all the standard file options (New, Open , Save, Save As, Save 
      All, Close, Close All, Print and Exit). Most of these can be given 
      shortcut keys (see next section). There is also a list of recently used 
      files, and an option called "Open Standard VDF Package". This seems to 
      work as a standard file open, except it starts in a different working 
      directory.</P>
      <H3>4.2 <A name=menu-edit>Edit Menu</A></H3>
      <P>Has the standard editing functions (Undo/Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste). Also 
      has Select All, Select Line, Delete Line, and the find and replace 
      functions (Goto Line, Find, Find Next, Replace). The final entry (Find in 
      Files) brings up the Windows Find Dialog.</P>
      <H3>4.3 <A name=menu-opt>Options Menu</A></H3>
      <P><B>System Parameters</B> lets you configure the VDF specific areas of 
      the Hammer. File associations, related programs and Language Keywords are 
      controlled here.<BR><B>Set Working Directory</B> sets the default starting 
      directory for File operations.<BR><B>Select Workspace</B> set the 
      currently active workspace. Using the correct workspace will help ensure 
      the FileView can find the correct associated files.<BR><B>Properties</B> 
      This allows you to configure the editor areas of the Hammer. If there is 
      no file open (the editor is not visible) then the System Parameters dialog 
      will show instead.</P>
      <H3>4.4 <A name=menu-build>Build Menu</A></H3>
      <P>Has the options Run, Precompile, Execute and DebugRun. These commands 
      are only available for files of a suitable type. You may also need to set 
      up information about your compiler and debugger in the System parameters 
      dialog.</P>
      <H3>4.5 <A name=menu-tools>Tools Menu</A></H3>
      <P><B>File Headers</B> lets you maintain and insert standard File Headers. 
      There are Global and User headers. The header will be inserted in the top 
      code area of the file to keep it IDE compliant. The insert options can be 
      set up with Shortcut Keys (ToolsInsertHeaderGlobal and 
      ToolsInsertHeaderUser commands)<BR><B>Autosuggestion Lists</B> Allows you 
      to bring up the various suggestion lists. See <A 
      href="#auto">Auto-Suggestion 
      Capabilities</A> for more information on using these. The Shortcut Key 
      commands for these all start with List.<BR><B>Macro</B> Allows records and 
      playback of macros. The macros can be assigned Shortcut Keys. Macros 
      cannot be deleted, but you can overwrite them or de-allocate the Shortcut 
      Key.<BR><B>Insert Revision Entry</B> Brings up an edit area that you can 
      type revision text in. This will be inserted in the revision section of 
      the header area. If you do not have a valid revision section, an error 
      will occur.<BR><B>ASDB Compiler</B> This runs through the base classes, 
      updating and expanding out the autosuggest database. This should be done 
      when ever the classes change. It is done for you during 
      installation.<BR><B>DosBox</B> Brings up the Smart Dosbox - which starts 
      in your appsrc directory.<BR><B>VDF Class Reference</B> Starts the <A 
      href="#parts-vdfcls">Class 
      Reference</A> program.<BR><B>Customize Items</B> This allows you to add or 
      change your own tools entries. </P>
      <H3>4.6 <A name=menu-window>Window Menu</A></H3>
      <P>Has the standard windows options (Cascade, Tile, Minimize/Restore all, 
      Split). At the bottom has the list of currently loaded files. Also has the 
      following:<BR><B>Display Options</B> Hide/Show the CodeExplorer and Error 
      List windows.<BR><B>Error List</B> Jump to the error list (if 
      visible)<BR><B>Code Explorer</B> Jump to the code explorer. If already 
      there, switch windows.<BR><B>Synchronize CodeView</B> Synchronize the 
      location in the CodeView with the current cursor location in the Edit 
      Window. </P>
      <H3>4.7 <A name=menu-help>Help Menu</A></H3>
      <P>Most of the menu items here do not work at present, as the help files 
      have not yet been created. The About box does work.</P>
      <H3>4.8 <A name=menu-tbar>Toolbar</A></H3>
      <P>The toolbar has some of the most common commands on it. The Properties 
      button at the end will bring up the Editor Properties if a file is loaded, 
      and the System Parameters if not. </P>
      <H2><A name=commands>5. Editor Commands and Shortcut Keys.</A></H2>
      <H3>5.1 <A name=cmd-over>OverView</A></H3>
      <P>The CodeMax editor comes with a large number of built in commands. Some 
      of these come with Shortcut (or Hot) keys already established, some do 
      not. Many of these are not available any other way. These can all be 
      modified to your own specifications in the Properties Dialog, Keyboard 
      Tab. Multiple keyboard assignments for the same command are accepted. It 
      is recommended that you take a quick look through the commands listed 
      there and see which you might use. Some commands you may wish to use are 
      listed below</P>

      <H2><A name=trouble>6. Trouble Shooting.</A></H2>
      <H3>6.1 <A name=tr-switch1>How do I jump to an object from the 
      CodeView?</A></H3>
      <P><B>Question:</B> When I click on an object in the CodeView, the edit 
      object does not relocate to that object. Shouldn't this 
      work?<BR><B>Answer:</B> This is not working on some (all?) 
      machines.Pressing Enter will synchronise the edit area with the object, 
      tab will move you to the edit area. To sychronise object view with the 
      edit area use Ctrl+S</P>
      <H3>6.2 <A name=tr-switch2>Why doesn't the mouse work on auto-suggest 
      lists?</A></H3>
      <P><B>Question:</B> Doubleclicking on a autosuggestion list will not do 
      anything. How do I select the correct item?<BR><B>Answer:</B> Use Tab or 
      Enter. The mouse does not work here.</P>
      <H3>6.3 <A name=tr-config>How do I configure the Hammer?</A></H3>
      <P><B>Question:</B> What configuration options are available and 
      where?<BR><B>Answer:</B> Under the options menu there are two options that 
      allow configuration.<BR><B>System Parameters</B> will give you access to 
      options about the editor as a whole. File associations, related programs 
      and Language Keywords are controlled here.<BR><B>Properties</B> will give 
      you access to the CodeMax Properties Box. This is also available from the 
      right-click menu on the edit window. Settings that affect the edit window 
      itself are controlled here - Color settings, Tab spacing, Shortcut keys 
      and miscellaneous other settings.</P>
      <P>Note that CodeMax properties are only available if the editor is 
      visible (ie if you have a file open). Otherwise you will get the System 
      Parameters instead.</P>
      <H3>6.4 <A name=tr-case>How do I control the auto-change of Case on 
      Keywords?</A></H3>
      <P><B>Question:</B> What controls are available for auto-changing of 
      case?<BR><B>Answer:</B> Words defined in the Keyword or Scope lists 
      (Options/System Parameters and the Language Highlighting tab) are changed 
      to use that case. If you want something different, or wish to add 
      keywords, just modify the list. This whole case changing function can be 
      turned off/on in the CodeMax Properties Box (Option/Properties) at the 
      bottom of the Language/Tabs tabpage.</P>
      <P>One known bug relating to this area in the current version is that #IF 
      has not been defined as a Scope Keyword.</P>
      <H3>6.5 <A name=tr-treeup>Why doesn't the CodeView tree update when I add 
      a procedure?</A></H3>
      <P><B>Question:</B> After I write End_Procedure the CodeView tree does not 
      always update.<BR><B>Answer:</B> The process that updates the CodeView is 
      only run when the linecount of the file changes. This is for performance 
      reasons. This procedure also checks to make sure that the opening and 
      closing scopes match up, and will only update when this is the case. So 
      the CodeView tree will only update when the procedure is finished and then 
      the line count changes again.</P>
      <P>This can also lead to the CodeView tree being empty. If you save a file 
      with an unfinished procedure in it and then re-open it, because the number 
      of start and finishing scopes does not match up, then it does not display 
      at all.</P>
      <H3>6.6 <A name=tr-keysave>How do I export and import my Shortcut Key 
      definitions?</A></H3>
      <P><B>Question:</B> How do I export and import my Shortcut Key 
      definitions?<BR><B>Answer:</B> These are stored in the CodeMaxEditor.Ini 
      file in the line starting with PSHOTKEYS. Copy and paste this line to a 
      text file to save it. Restore by copying back to the same location. </P>
      <H3>6.7 The Hammer crashes when i start it, what gives?</H3>
      <P><B>Question:</B> Why does the Hammer crash while i just want to start 
      it?<BR><B>Answer:</B> We have seen occasions on which the Hammer crashes 
      immediately when you start it. This is mainly due to a corrupt 
      CodeMaxEditor.Ini file. If you already had a working version of the hammer 
      installed, you might want to copy that one over, otherwise get one from a 
      fellow programmer. Optionally you can edit this file with Notepad and scan 
      it for folders not available on your machine.</P>
